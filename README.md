## API
In use with the Cachow API located at https://github.com/LSunny5/CaChow-API

### Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Cachow is a site where you can see and enter menus for different restaurants and easily access it from one site. The inspiration is from family and friends who are always browsing through several sites to find the menus for different food places. With Cachow, you can have all your menus in one place and search through multiple menus. The address and phone numbers can be added as well.  If the restaurant is not there, you can add it and it will be in your list.  There is a demo account to try it out.  Visit the site to check it out.  You can register and sign up for your own account after.   

### Technologies Used
React, Javascript, HTML5/CSS3
